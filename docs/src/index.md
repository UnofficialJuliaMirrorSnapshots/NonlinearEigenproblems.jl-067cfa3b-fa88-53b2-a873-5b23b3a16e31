# NEP-PACK

NEP-PACK is a package with implementations of methods to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems of
the type: Find ``(λ,v)\in\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{C}^n`` such that
```math
M(λ)v=0
```
and ``v\neq 0``.


# Getting started

Install it as a registered  package in Julia's REPL package mode by
typing `] add Nonline...`:
```
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add NonlinearEigenproblems
```
Then we can start to load the NEP-PACK package
```julia-repl
julia> using NonlinearEigenproblems
```
As a first example we will solve the NEP associated with the matrix polynomial

```math
M(λ)=\begin{bmatrix}1&3\newline5&6\end{bmatrix}+
λ\begin{bmatrix}3&4\newline6&6\end{bmatrix}+
λ^2\begin{bmatrix}1&0\newline0&1\end{bmatrix}
```
The following code creates this NEP, by constructing an object called
[`PEP`](types.md#PEP-1), an abbreviation for polynomial eigenvalue problem.
It subsequencly solves it using the NEP solution method implemented
in [`polyeig()`](methods.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.NEPSolver.polyeig):
```julia-repl
julia> A0=[1.0 3; 5 6]; A1=[3.0 4; 6 6]; A2=[1.0 0; 0 1.0];
julia> nep=PEP([A0,A1,A2])
PEP(2, Array{Float64,2}[[1.0 3.0; 5.0 6.0], [3.0 4.0; 6.0 6.0], [1.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0]])
julia> λ,v=polyeig(nep)
(Complex{Float64}[1.36267+0.0im, -0.824084+0.280682im, -0.824084-0.280682im, -8.7145+0.0im], Complex{Float64}[-1.0+0.0im 0.739183-0.196401im 0.739183+0.196401im 0.627138+0.0im; 0.821812+0.0im -0.501408-0.375337im -0.501408+0.375337im 1.0+0.0im])
```
You have now solved your first nonlinear eigenvalue problem with NEP-PACK.

In order to verify that we have a solution, we can check that  ``M(λ)`` is singular,
with a singular vector ``v`` such that ``M(λ)v=0``:
```julia-repl
julia> λ1=λ[1]; v1=v[:,1];
julia> using LinearAlgebra # the norm-function is in this Julia package
julia> norm(A0*v1+λ1*A1*v1+λ1^2*v1)/norm(v1)
1.1502634749464687e-14
```


# Accessing more complicated applications

We have made benchmark examples available through the function [`nep_gallery`](gallery.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.nep_gallery):

```julia-repl
julia> nep=nep_gallery("dep0",100);
julia> size(nep)
(100, 100)
julia> λ,v=mslp(nep,tol=1e-10);
julia> λ
0.23169217667341738 - 2.1866254654451488e-16im
julia> size(v)
(100,)
julia> resnorm=norm(compute_Mlincomb(nep,λ,v))
3.124042808475689e-14
```
Information about the gallery can be found by typing `?nep_gallery`.
The second arument in the call to `nep_gallery` is a problem parameter,
in this case specifying that the  size of the problem should be `100`.
The example solves the problem with the NEP-algorithm [`MSLP`](methods.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.NEPSolver.mslp).
The parameter `tol` specifies the
tolerance for iteration termination.

!!! note
    All the NEP-solvers have considerble documentation easily available.
    Every NEP-solver has documentation accompanied with at least one example,
    and references to corresponding research papers, which we strongly recommend you
    to cite if you use the method.
    This is available to you in Julia's repl-prompt. Type `?mslp` and you will see
    an example how to use `mslp` and that citation credit should go to *A. Ruhe,
    Algorithms for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, SIAM J. Numer. Anal.
    10 (1973) 674-689*. This documentation is the same as the online documentation
    under the tab [NEP Methods](methods.md).



# A model of a neuron

The following (delay) differential equation models a neuron
```math
\dot{x}_1(t)=-\kappa x_1(t)+\beta\tanh(x_1(t-\tau_3))+a_1\tanh(x_2(t-\tau_2))
```
```math
\dot{x}_2(t)=-\kappa x_2(t)+\beta\tanh(x_2(t-\tau_3))+a_2\tanh(x_1(t-\tau_1))
```
See [L. P. Shayer and S. A. Campbell.  Stability, bifurcation and multistability in a system of two
coupled neurons with multiple time delays. SIAM J. Applied Mathematics , 61(2):673–700, 2000](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3061744?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). It is
also available as a first demo in [DDE-BIFTOOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddebiftool/).
The linear stability analysis of this problem requires the solution
of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem
```math
M(λ)=-λI+A_0+A_1e^{-\tau_1λ}+A_2e^{-\tau_2λ}+A_3e^{-\tau_3λ}
```
where the matrices are the Jacobian at the stationary solution.
For the zero stationary solution, the matrices are
```julia-repl
kappa=0.5; a2=2.34; a1=1; beta=-1;
A0=-kappa*[1 0; 0 1];
A1=a2*[0 0; 1 0];
A2=a1*[0 1; 0 0];
A3=beta*[1 0; 0 1];
```
We can now create the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and compute the stability
by first creating the problem
```julia-repl
julia> tauv=[0;0.2;0.2;1.5];
julia> dep=DEP([A0, A1,   A2, A3],tauv);
```
The constructor  [`DEP`](types.md#DEP-1) is an abbreviation for a delay eigenvalue problem, which
is a NEP with exponential terms stemming from the stability
analysis of a delay-differential equation. See [`types`](types.md) for other NEP-types.
You can now solve this NEP, for instance,
with the [infinite Arnoldi method](methods.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.NEPSolver.iar_chebyshev):
```julia-repl
julia> λ,V=iar_chebyshev(dep,maxit=100); # This takes some time the first time is run due to JIT-compiler
```
The figure in a demo of DDE-BIFTOOL <http://ddebiftool.sourceforge.net/demos/neuron/html/demo1_stst.html#3> can be directly generated by
```@example
using PyPlot
# Hardcoded/cached values in the documentation compilation  # hide

!!! tip
    This problem is also available in the `Gallery` by calling `dep=nep_gallery("neuron0")`. Most of the NEPs constructed in the tutorials are also available in corresponding gallery problems. See all gallery problems under [NEP Gallery](gallery.md). In particular, note that the problems in the Berlin-Manchester collection of problems NLEVP are also [directly available](gallery.md#Berlin-Manchester-collection-1).

# The "gun" benchmark problem

One of the most common benchmark problems for NEPs is the so-called "gun"-problem.
It models an electromagnetic cavity, and it is directly available in the NEP-PACK
gallery.
(See [gallery](gallery.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.Gallery.nep_gallery) references or type `?nep_gallery` at the repl-prompt.) This is how you can set it up and solve it with the [block Newton method](methods.md#NonlinearEigenproblems.NEPSolver.blocknewton):

```julia-repl
julia> nep=nep_gallery("nlevp_native_gun");
julia> n=size(nep,1)
julia> S=150^2*[1.0 0; 0 1]; V=[[1 0; 0 1]; zeros(n-2,2)];
julia> (Z,X)=blocknewton(nep,S=S,X=V,displaylevel=1,armijo_factor=0.5,maxit=20)
Iteration 1: Error: 6.081316e+03
Iteration 2: Error: 1.701970e-02 Armijo scaling=0.031250
Iteration 3: Error: 1.814887e-02 Armijo scaling=0.250000
...
Iteration 13: Error: 6.257442e-09
Iteration 14: Error: 2.525942e-15
```
This algorithm returns a partial Schur factorization
of the NEP, and therefore the eigenvalues of the small matrix
`Z` are eigenvalues of the problem. An eigenpair of the NEP
can be extracted by diagonalizing:
```julia-repl
julia> using LinearAlgebra
julia> (Λ,P)=eigen(Z);
julia> VV=X*P;  # Construct the eigenvector matrix
julia> v=VV[:,1]; λ=Λ[1]
61330.208714730004 + 63185.15983933589im
julia> norm(compute_Mlincomb(nep,λ,v)) # Very small residual
1.8270553408452648e-16
```

If you use the NEP-algorithms for research, please
give the author of the algorithm credit by citiation. The
recommended citation can be found in the function
documentation, e.g., `?blocknewton`.

# Your own NEP nonlinearity

As an application researcher, we recommend that you first try to
express your problem in the following form since it
gives access to several efficient routines associated with the NEP,
in turn making it possible to use many NEP-solvers. A problem that can be expressed as a (short) **S**um of **P**roducts of **M**atrices and **F**unctions
can be represented with the objects of type [`SPMF`](types.md#SPMF-1)
in NEP-PACK. For instance, a problem with three terms
```math
M(λ) = A+λB+e^{\sin(λ/2)}C
```
can be created by
```julia-repl
julia> A=(1:4)*(1:4)'+I; B=diagm(1 => [1,2,3]); C=ones(4,4);
julia> f1= λ-> one(λ);
julia> f2= λ-> λ;
julia> f3= λ-> exp(sin(λ/2))
julia> nep=SPMF_NEP([A,B,C],[f1,f2,f3]);
```
The NEP can now be solved with many algorithms, e.g.,
```julia-repl
julia> λ,v=quasinewton(nep,λ=3)
(3.176099007141426 + 0.0im, Complex{Float64}[37.1759+0.0im, -21.3016+0.0im, 0.0937992+0.0im, -1.15711+0.0im])
```
Note that the functions `f1`,`f2` and `f3` have to be defined for scalar values
and for matrices (in the matrix function sense, not elementwise sense). This is
the reason `f1` needs to be defined as `one(λ)`, instead of just `1`.

As usual, you can check that we computed a sensible solution:
```julia-repl
julia> (A+B*λ+C*exp(sin(λ/2)))*v
4-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
  -6.586145128765412e-14 + 0.0im
  2.8285461200559146e-14 + 0.0im
 -4.1550357082583515e-14 + 0.0im
  -8.815768150428286e-15 + 0.0im
```
