# LinSolvers

Most NEP-algorithms need to solve the linear system associated with `M(λ)`.
We provide an interface to specify which solver to use or define your own solver.

# EigSolvers

Some NEP-algorithms need to solve an associated linear eigenvalue problem. associated with `M(λ)`.
You will likely only need the native eigensolvers in Julia.
Nevertheless, we provide an interface to specify which solver to use or define your own solver.
