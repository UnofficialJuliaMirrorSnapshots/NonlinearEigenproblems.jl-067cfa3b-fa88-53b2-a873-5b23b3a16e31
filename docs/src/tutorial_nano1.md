# Tutorial: Problem from nanophotonics

One of the key challanges within
the
[field of nanophotonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanophotonics)
is the need to be able to compute the modes of
frequency-despersive structures in
a reliable and efficient way.
The frequency (i.e. eigenvalue) dependency can be viewed
as a nonlinearity and therefore naturally
leads to nonlinear eigenvalue problems.


This tutorial is based on a
[research preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02363.pdf)
where a model is set up and solved with [SLEPc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLEPc).
An associated
[repository of code](https://gitlab.onelab.info/doc/models/tree/master/NonLinearEVP) is available
which should be used in
combination with [gmsh](http://gmsh.info) and [onelab](http://onelab.info/).
Credit for the discretization and application should go
to the authors of the paper, in particular
Guillaume Demésy for providing the model files online.

We will use the code and reproduce
results using NEP-PACK to illustrate
how we solve such problems in nanophotonics.


## Part 1: Setup the matrices

You need to download the code with the model
of the frequency-dispersive media
[here](https://gitlab.onelab.info/doc/models/tree/master/NonLinearEVP).
You also need to install ONELAB from [http://onelab.info/](http://onelab.info/).

We need the matrices generated by
this model, which are not by default saved to disk,
so a small modification of the project files is needed.
You need to modify the `NonLinearEVP.pro`:
On the line before the EigenSolve call to
for the `res_NEP_E`:
```
Print[M1] // Add this line
EigenSolve[M1,neig,eig_target_re,eig_target_im,EigFilter[],
     { {1}, {-eps_oo_1,gam_1*eps_oo_1, -om_d_1^2,0}, {-1,0,0} },
     { {1}, {1,-gam_1},                              {1} } ];
```
That is, you should add the text `Print[M1]` (in the current version) before
line 354.

After you do this modification, load the model and click "run" in the Gmsh tool,
you will obtain files in the current
directory containing the FEM-discretizations
needed to set up the problem (`file_mat_MX.m.bin`).

## Part 2: Implementation in NEP-PACK

The NEP in this problem has the structure
```math
M(λ)=A_1+\frac{-\varepsilon_{\infty}λ^3+\varepsilon_{\infty}\gamma_d λ^2-\omega_d^2λ}{λ-\gamma_d}A_2-λ^2A_3
```
The constants are given in the project file and we
set them in our julia code:
```julia
a_lat=50;
cel      = a_lat/(2*pi);
nrm     = a_lat/(2*pi*cel);
om_d_1         = om_d_1        / nrm;
gam_1          = gam_1         / nrm;
```
The NEP in this example can be conveniently
expressed as a [`SPMF`](types.md#SPMF-1), where the first function
is constant, the second term is a rational
function and
the third is a quadratic term.
We define them in a matrix function sense:
```julia
f1=s-> one(s) #
f2=s-> (s-gam_1*one(s))\(-eps_oo_1*s^3+gam_1*eps_oo_1*s^2-om_d_1^2*s)
f3=s-> -s^2
```
If you have carried out Part 1, you should have
the sparse discretization matrices available.
They are stored in the PETSc-binary format.
NEP-PACK contains functionality to load
some PETSc binary files
(see also
[`PETScBinary`](https://github.com/tkonolige/PETScBinaryIO.jl)).
Most importantly the
function `Gallery.naive_petsc_read`
which gives us a sparse matrix.

Suppose `gmsh_files` is a path to the bin-files. These
commands loads the matrices
```julia
julia> A3=Gallery.naive_petsc_read(joinpath(gmsh_files,"file_mat_M15.m.bin")); # Switched order is intentional
julia> A2=Gallery.naive_petsc_read(joinpath(gmsh_files,"file_mat_M16.m.bin"));
julia> A1=Gallery.naive_petsc_read(joinpath(gmsh_files,"file_mat_M17.m.bin"));
```
The SPMF is created directly
```julia
julia> nep=SPMF_NEP([A1,A2,A3], [f1,f2,f3]);
```
We can now directly apply a method of choice.
In this case we solve it with the tensor
infinite Arnoldi method (`tiar`)  with a shift/target
the same as in the project files
```julia-repl
julia> (λ,V)=tiar(nep,σ=0.00243604+0.366703im,logger=1,neigs=10,maxit=100);

Each row in the logger printout of `tiar` corresponds
to an iteration. The sign `-` corresponds to
an unconverged eigenvalue, `+` corresponds to a converged
eigenvalue and `=` corresponds to an eigenvalue which
is almost converged (interpreted as a factor 10 from
the convergence criteria).
The eigenvalue  `0.007774845736605659 + 0.25923501436468327im`
which can be found in the printout above,
is reported by the default setting in the gmsh tool.
