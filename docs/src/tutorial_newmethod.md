# Tutorial: Implementing your own method

Although we try to provide state-of-the-art algorithms
in NEP-PACK, you may want to implement a solver
which is not available in NEP-PACK.
By using the NEP-PACK data types and structures
you can make your life easier in several ways.
You do not need to know the internals of NEP-PACK.
Correct usage, will give you access to many applications,
helper functionality to combine with,
and you will have to possibility to compare your method
with other solvers.
We now illustrate how to implement your
own solver.

## Halley's method

[Halley's method for root-finding of nonlinear scalar equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_method)
has fast local convergence - even faster
than Newton's method in terms of iterations.
A NEP can be formulated as a
root-finding problem since a solution will always
satisfy
```math
f(λ)=\det(M(λ))=0
```
The application of Halley's method to this nonlinear scalar equation
will serve as an example solver, although it does, to our
knowledge, not lead to a competive algorithm.
Halley's method for the root-finding problem is
defined as the
```math
λ_{k+1}=λ_k-\frac{2f(λ_k)f'(λ_k)}{2(f'(λ_k))^2-f(λ_k)f''(λ_k)}
```
Although there are formulas for the
derivatives of the determinant, we will here for
simplicity just use finite difference to
estimate the derivatives, i.e.,
```math
 f'(λ)\approx \frac{f(λ+δ)-f(λ-δ)}{2δ}
```
```math
 f''(λ)\approx \frac{f(λ+δ)-2f(λ)+f(λ-δ)}{δ^2}
```
## Implementation in NEP-PACK (preliminary version)

Let us first define our solver function
and introduce the function of which we wish to find the roots.
The matrix ``M(λ)`` is obtained from the
`compute_Mder`-function.
```julia
using NonlinearEigenproblems
function halley(nep::NEP;λ=0.0,δ=sqrt(eps()),maxit=100,tol=eps()*100)
   f=s-> det(compute_Mder(nep,s)); # The objective function
   # More code here
end
```
The main loop (which should go in *More code here*) can be implemented,
in a way that does not involve many function
evaluations, as follows:
```julia
   for i=1:maxit
       fλ=f(λ)
       fλp=f(λ+δ)
       fλm=f(λ-δ)
       fp=(fλp-fλm)/(2δ)
       fpp=(fλp-2*fλ+fλm)/(δ^2)
       Δλ=2*fλ*fp/(2*fp^2-fλ*fpp);
       λ=λ-Δλ;
       @show (i,λ)
       if (abs(Δλ)<tol)
          return λ
       end
   end
```
Let's test our code on a benchmark problem:
```julia
julia> nep=nep_gallery("dep0");
julia> λ=halley(nep)
(i, λ) = (1, -0.08425238005323712)
(i, λ) = (2, -0.14769529096609657)
(i, λ) = (3, -0.443164132772242)
(i, λ) = (4, -0.3653012970379835)
(i, λ) = (5, -0.35874460050208345)
(i, λ) = (6, -0.3587189462161427)
(i, λ) = (7, -0.35871894596862675)
(i, λ) = (8, -0.3587189459686267)
```
Clearly, the algorithm terminates after 8 iterations.
We can verify that this is actually
a solution easily if we also
have an approximate eigenvector. An eigenvector
can be computed by essentially one step of inverse iteration,
on the matrix ``M(λ)``:
```julia
julia> x=normalize(compute_Mder(nep,λ)\ones(size(nep,1)))
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
 -0.3170546135678643
  0.15957983055370098
 -0.30996780934165974
  0.5577415634513512
  0.6832678503094953
```
The residual norm  ``|M(λ)x|`` does indeed become almost zero
so it seems we have a solution:
```julia
julia> norm(compute_Mlincomb(nep,λ,x))
6.735017818475343e-16
```

## Implementation in NEP-PACK (full version)

In the following we illustrate a more advanced
usage of the NEP-PACK method development:
NEP-PACKs logging facility  and error estimation.
See [`Logger`](logger.md) and [`Errmeasure`](errmeasure.md). This
gives access
to other ways to measure error as well as a logging
which is the same for all solvers and simplifies
comparisons.

```julia
using NonlinearEigenproblems, LinearAlgebra, Plots
function halley(nep::NEP;λ=0.0,δ=sqrt(eps()),maxit=100,
                tol=eps()*100,logger=0,
                errmeasure = DefaultErrmeasure(nep))
    # Setup the logger.
    @parse_logger_param!(logger);

    n=size(nep,1);
    f=s-> det(compute_Mder(nep,s)); # The objective function


    for i=1:maxit
        fλ=f(λ)
        fλp=f(λ+δ)
        fλm=f(λ-δ)
        fp=(fλp-fλm)/(2δ)
        fpp=(fλp-2*fλ+fλm)/(δ^2)
        Δλ=2*fλ*fp/(2*fp^2-fλ*fpp);
        λ=λ-Δλ;
        # Compute an eigenvector. This will not work if the
        # eigenvector is orthogonal to ones(n)
        x=normalize(compute_Mder(nep,λ)\ones(n));
        err=estimate_error(ermdata,λ,x)  # Estimate the error
        push_iteration_info!(logger,i; λ=λ,err=err) # Put it into the log
        if (err<tol)
            return (λ,x)
        end
    end
end
```

We can now run our new method using with a `logger=1` keyword
argument
so we get the standardized output of iteration info:
```julia-repl
julia> (λ,x)=halley(nep,logger=1);
iter 1 err:0.08492602120772309 λ=-0.08425238005323712
iter 2 err:0.07450867012944977 λ=-0.14769529096609657
iter 3 err:0.032639292900081246 λ=-0.443164132772242
iter 4 err:0.00281602165251169 λ=-0.3653012970379835
iter 5 err:1.1025990567599428e-5 λ=-0.35874460050208345
iter 6 err:1.0638098128402615e-10 λ=-0.3587189462161427
iter 7 err:4.942402279980973e-17 λ=-0.35871894596862675
julia> norm(compute_Mlincomb(nep,λ,x))
5.613646650354486e-16
```
If you now want to plot the error history,
you can use the `ErrorLogger`:
```julia-repl
julia> mylogger=ErrorLogger()
julia> (λ,x)=halley(nep,logger=mylogger);
julia> plot(mylogger.errs[1:10,1],yaxis=:log)
```
We clearly observe the superlinear convergence:
```@example
using PyPlot # hide
clf(); # hide
z=[ 0.08492602120772309   # hide
        0.07450867012944977 # hide
